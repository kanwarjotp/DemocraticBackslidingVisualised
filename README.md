# Democratic Backsliding Visualised

## Motivation

In this project, I aim to uncover the complex truths of Democratic Backsliding– expansion of
executive powers, muzzling free press, suppression of dissent among others, across the globe
According to research (Grillo, Luo, Nalepa, & Prato, 2024) we can establish that, in a polity there
exists three key members the incumbent, the opposition, and the electorate. Therefore, to
perform any kind of analysis, data about these three entities is a necessary and sufficient
prerequisite.
<br>
The executive and opposition, are institutionalized members of a political system and thus
democracy indicators such as press freedom, judicial autonomy etc. are directly affected by these.
To inform my research on these institutionalized channels, I used the V-DEM Democracy
Indicators dataset.
<br>

The electorate however, is a much more complex definition, harder to quantify. According to Jones
(2022), protests – their motivation, nature, and outcome are key indicators for the holistic review
of the electorate in a democracy. Therefore, in addition to the V-DEM dataset, I have used the
Global Protest Tracker dataset.
<br>
Using these data sources, I intend to gain insight into factors responsible democratic backsliding –
visualize the incumbent’s role, map its extent, identify and graph the role of the opposition, and
understand and depict the influence and response of the electorate in the democratic process in
various countries.

## Implementation
To run the implementation, you can use the “Live Server” extension in VS Code to run the
index.html website. An internet connection is required. A wide screen display, with a 16:9 aspect
ratio and at least a 1600px x 900px window is recommended for optimal experience.
Note: Trying to open “index.html” directly will not work as the CORS policy on browser does
not allow loadng scripts when the data from a different domain than the original one (all the
scripts, index.html and css should be in the same folder, and even then it may fail)

Sample user flow:
* Loading the website
* Scrolling down to the Bubble Plot and Sankey Diagram
** Clicking on a Bubble, say South Korea
** Using the Play button, to start the animation
* Stepping through the years manually, dragging the timeline bar
* Hovering over the updating Sankey Diagram
* Scrolling down to the World Map
* Clicking the Play button in the sidebar, to start animation.
* Observe change sin the protest bar
* Stop the year slider at a desired year
* Click on one of the protests from the bar
* View the opened up drawer, with protest deep dive, close the drawer.
* Selecting another country of their choice
* Studying the democratic indicators linechart
* Scrolling up to the Bubble Plot, after selecting a country on the world map
* Following its journey using the bubble plot and the sankey diagram
